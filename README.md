# ProjectEMMA
Concept product for Exwire. Project EMMA (Exwire, Movement, Addon)
# The device
This device is a joystick used for gaming, but you can alter the joystick position using the servos inside the device.

## Parts
We are going to be using either an Arduino Micro or an Raspberry pi Pico for the brains of the build.
For the casing we plan on firt using 3d printed plastic and later switch to a more durable material
As for the joystick itsself we'll be using a generic joystick of a good quality. And to make the joystick configurable we will add a servo.

To put everything together we will be making custom pcb's hence the name **Exwire**
